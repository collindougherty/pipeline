## Problem formulation 
Data manipulation and cleaning process is repeated any time models are trained; thus, training a model is extremely time intensive, before it is even clear if the exercise is likely to be fruitful. 

## Objective
To deliver a machine learning suitable database by uploading only the PUF. The dataframe output should be suitable for either 
neural networks (ie matrices of 1s and 0s) or random forests. All data is preserved, and variables are appropriately treated according to variable type.

The following is based on the 2020 NCDB PUF data dictionary, found here: https://www.facs.org/media/brilfbgu/puf-2020-data-dictionary.pdf

Contributions and collaboration are welcomed.
